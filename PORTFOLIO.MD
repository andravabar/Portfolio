## 1. **Project**
### **Upgrading the Timetable called _TAHVEL_**
- Our school project about upgrading _TAHVEL_ took place during the period of 30.09 - 02.10.2020. 
- Our goal was to upgrade the commonly used timetable of _TAHVEL_ which has many disadvantages in terms of user-friendlyness, design, and functionality. The purpose of the project was to develop a better version of the _TAHVEL_, which would work both in the mobile device and desktop. 
- We needed to create the working prototype in Figma, also provide the example in zone-server to show the actual layout of the new _TAHVEL_.

### **My role in the team**
I had 3 responsibilitis:
- provide the full documentation of the process with all the details
- run as the Github administrator
- provide input in terms of functionality and design
